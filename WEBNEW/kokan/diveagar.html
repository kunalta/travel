<p>diveagar (Dive Agar) is a village located in Shrivardhan Taluka, Raigad district in the Indian state of Maharashtra,[2] approximately 170 kilometers south of Mumbai.The area is peaceful, clean and sparsely populated. The region includes a fishing settlement, a beach, a temple, local businesses engaged in coconut and beetle nut tree farming, and some tourism businesses such as restaurants, cottage rentals and hotels, and six villages (from north to south): Velas, Musalmandi, Agar Panchaitan, Diveagar, Borli Panchatan, and Karle. The beach, facing the Arabian Sea, is approximately four kilometers long[3] and undeveloped. At the north end of the beach where a small stream enters the ocean there is the fishing settlement, Velas Agar, and some paddy farming, while at the south end there is a sanctuary for migratory seabirds. Nearby, there is a small fishing village, where vendors sell fresh fish, which goes by name of Bharadkhol.[4] The beach is accessible from the Mumbai-Goa highway via Kolad or Karnala.

The beach contains a number of suru trees (Casuarina), which are common to coastal Maharashtra. The access to the beach has a dense cover of belu trees, which are otherwise uncommon in the area.[5]

Diveagar is a popular beach destination from the nearby towns of Shrivardhan and Harihareshwar.</p>

<P>Sand-bubble crabs can be found on the beach and at nearby Harihareshwar one can find dolphins. Some seaturtles still lay their eggs on the beach.
