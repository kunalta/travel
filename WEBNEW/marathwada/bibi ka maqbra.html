<h1>BIBI KA MAKBARA</h1>
<p>The Bibi Ka Maqbara is a tomb located in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah in the memory of his mother (posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani). It bears a striking resemblance to the famous Taj Mahal,[7] the mausoleum of wife of Shah Jahan. He had built the Badshahi Mosque at Lahore one of the largest Mosques in the world and the largest one at that time, as well as the small, but elegant, Pearl Mosque at Delhi.

<p>The comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obscured its very own considerable charm.[10] Due to the strong resemblance, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan). The Bibi Ka Maqbara is the principal monument of Aurangabad and its historic city. An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively.[4] Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.
