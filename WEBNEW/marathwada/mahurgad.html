<P>Mahur or Mahurgad is a town and religious place in Nanded district of Maharashtra, India.[1] Mahur is the birthplace of Hindu God Dattatreya.[2] Atri Rishi and Sati Anusaya Mata lived here. Brahmadev, Vishnudev and Lord Shiva once got a news about Anusaya Mata that there is no one more pious and pure as her. To test her piousness they arrived under the garb of asking Alm (bhiksha). When she brought it, they asked to serve them while being naked, she realized by her power that she is under a test. She made them a three headed child & fed them. This became Dattatreya, the unified God.

<br>There are three mountains in Mahur. The first one and most known is having Renuka Mata Temple, who is mother of the god Parshuram. Other two are called Datt Shikhar and Atri Anasuya Shikar Temple's. Mahur has a sacred temple to Renuka Mata, which is considered one of the three and half Shakti Peethas (temples) in the state. A big fair is held here every year on the occasion of Vijayadashami.[citation needed]

<br>When Sahasrarjun attacked Renuka Devi, while somewhere in today's Telangana, for he wanted to grab the Sacred Kamdhenu cow (This Sacred Cow has divine power to fulfill the wish). When Renuka Mata refused to him that saying asking gift of your own choice by the guest visitor is uncalled. He attacked her & injured her. She dies in this & when Lord Parshuram knew about it, he went berserk. Then the elderly people pacified him & asked him to do the last rites in Mahur under Dattatreya's guidance. Then he was told by him that Renuka Mata will appear on first mountain for you to worship. This became the famous Renuka Mata temple. The "Matru Tirth" (means sacred place for Mother's worship) Place on this Mountain is the one which is where today stands a lake, is "Antyeshti Sthan" (Means place where last rites were performed).[citation needed]

<br>There are many other temples in Mahur like Rishi Jamdagni Temple, Lord Parshuram Temple, Kalika Mata Temple, Devdevshwar Temple, and also the Caves called Pandav Leni.[citation needed]
