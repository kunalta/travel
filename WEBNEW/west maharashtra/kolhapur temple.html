History
Date built:	7th century
<p>The Shri Mahalakshmi (AmbaBai) Temple[1] of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, India, is one of the 18 Shakti Peethas listed in various puranas of Hinduism. The temple is of special religious significance and is considered to be a place where Shakti (goddess of empowerment) manifests and as one of only six sacred houses of Shakti where worshipers can either be freed from or granted their longings.[2]

Located on the banks of the Panchganga River, about 156 miles (252km) south of Pune,[1] the Kolhapur Shakti Peetha takes its name from Lakshmi, the four-armed, gemstone-adorned goddess of good fortune, the universal form of whom is Shakti. Lakshmi is endowed with six divine qualities, among them prosperity (spiritual and material).[2] It is believed that the divine couple, Lakshmi and Vishnu reside in the area
