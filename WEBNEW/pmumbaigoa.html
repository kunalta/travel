<button class="collapsible"><b>Day 1: Arrival - Mumbai</b></button>
<div class="content">
<p>On your arrival in Mumbai Airport meet our tour representative who further escorts you to your pre-booked hotel. Check-in and relax in your hotel. Rest of the time is to be spent at leisure. In the evening take a stroll around the locale if you wish to. Return to your hotel by evening, have dinner and stay overnight.</p>
<p>Mumbai was given the name City of Dreams owing to tremendous opportunity it holds, mainly in Hindi cinema. The city is the capital of Maharashtra and overlooks the gamboling waves of Arabian Sea. Its cityscape might remind you of that of New York. But along with the bustling nooks, Mumbai has clung on to its heritage and history and takes immense pride in all of that. It is unarguable that this very city gives a cut-throat competition to even the most developed cities worldwide, let alone of India.</p>
</div>
<br>
<button class="collapsible"> <b>Day2: Mumbai </b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Have your breakfast in the morning and proceed for Mumbai sightseeing session, which includes Elephanta Caves, Prince of Wales Museum, Hanging Garden, Juhu Beach, Gateway of India and Marine Drive.</p>
  <p>Elephanta cave is located in Gharapuri (The City of Caves), approximately ten kilometers away from Mumbai Harbor. The caves consists mainly of two groups- Hindu Caves (consisting if five caves) and Buddhist Caves (consisting of two caves). This rock-cut architecture adopted for the caves is datable to a time between 5th and 8th century. However an apt date of its construction is yet a mystery but historians have concluded them to the time when Mauryan rulers were defeated by Badami Chalukyas in 635 AD. Back then, the Elephanta was the capital of Konkan Mauryas and was called Puri or Purika. The caves today are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
  <p>Prince of Wales Museum is also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. It was founded in 20th century in order to commemorate the visit of Prince Wales. There are about 50000 exhibits inside the museum divided into three categories- Art, Archeology and Natural History. Artifacts and relics of Indus Valley Civilization, Guptas, Mauryas, Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas and others are put here for public display. Other than this, you can behold beautiful prints, illustration of different wildlife species, paintings, manuscripts etc.</p>
  <p>Just a few kilometers away from the museum is where the landmark of Mumbai stands, The Gateway of India. This structure was built in order to commemorate the visit of Their Majesties King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Take a leisure stroll in the Hanging Garden, which is perched at the top of Malabar Hill, overlooking the beautiful Arabian Sea. This manicured terrace garden is festooned with a huge variety of plants and flower species. Juhu Beach, the popular beach of Mumbai is thronged with visitors. Some of Mumbai’s best street food and restaurants are located here. Marine drive is located in the heart of Mumbai, just beside a busy road. But the horns and screeches of city’s road don’t really interrupt the serenity that is attained here while sipping a cup of coffee and just simply unwinding.</p>
  <p>Overnight stay in hotel</p>

St. Francis Xavier is regarded as the Patron Saint of Goa. The Church of St. Francis of Assisi was built in 1521 by the Portuguese rulers and marks the brilliance of architecture.
