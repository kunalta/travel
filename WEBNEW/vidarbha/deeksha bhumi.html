<br>Deekshabhoomi is in Nagpur, Maharashtra, a location regarded as a pilgrimage center of Buddhism in India. Millions of pilgrims visit Deekshabhoomi every year,[7] especially on Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din ("Mass Conversion Ceremony Day")[8] and 14 October, the memorial day when Ambedkar converted to Buddhism here. His final religious act was to embrace Buddhism.[7] Today, the largest stupa in Asia is erected in his memory at the site.[9]
