History
Not much is known about history of this place in ancient time and the Middle ages. In 1450 A.D., this area was given as jagir to local Kaji by Ala-ud-Din Ahmed Shah Bahmani of the Bahmani Sultanate. By 1550, this area came under rule of powerful Jadhav dynasty, which ruled the paragana of Sindkhed until 1724. During this period, they kept on shuffling their service with Mughal Empire and Ahmadnagar Sultanate as per situation. Emergence of Nizam of Hyderabad in south India changed political dynamics in this area. The area come under control Nizam by 1724. During the later part of 18th century, this area came under influence of the Shinde dynasty, which ruled it for about 60 years. In 1803, the Nizam of Hyderabad recaptured Sindkhed and restored the rule of Jadhav dynasty. The family lost possessions of the city in 1851 owing to an act of rebellion by Arab troops under their command leading to Sindkhed's downfall.[1] After the decline of the Nizam's rule, this area came under direct British rule.
